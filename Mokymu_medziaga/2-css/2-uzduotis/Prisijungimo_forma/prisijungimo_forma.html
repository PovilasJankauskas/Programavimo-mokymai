            Even the slightest sound does not escape this Pokémon’s notice. Azurill’s tail is large and bouncy. It is
            packed
            full of the nutrients this Pokémon needs to grow. Azurill can be seen bouncing and playing on its big,
            rubbery
            tail. Girafarig’s rear head contains a tiny brain that is too small for thinking. However, the rear head
            doesn’t
            need to sleep, so it can keep watch over its surroundings 24 hours a day.
